### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

<br>
My name is Anish and I'm a rising senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Northern Virginia. This summer, I'm applying novel machine learning algorithms as part of research internships at two universities, and am excited to continue to expand my knowledge in the field! In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, doing typing tests, and playing tennis.
