### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

<br>
My name is Anish and I am an incoming freshman at NYU completing a double major in Business, Technology, and Entrepreneurship (BTE Program, Stern School of Business) and Computer Science. This summer, I am continuing machine learning research and am excited to continue to expand my knowledge in the field! In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, completing typing tests, and playing tennis.
