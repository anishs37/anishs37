### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

<br>
My name is Anish and I'm a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Northern Virginia. This past summer, I worked with researchers at two universities to develop novel machine learning algorithms, and am excited to continue to expand upon these projects, and more broadly, my knowledge in the field throughout this year! In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, doing typing tests, and playing tennis.
